    # It's all very ugly, but works correctly, and so far I'm not able to come
    # up with better alternatives (see below why --cursor etc isn't helpful for us).
    #
    # Let me explain what they mean exactly. Let's consider that we have the following
    # logs, some of which we already have loaded, and now we need to get the next page:
    #
    #    ........
    #    2025-03-10T11:49:44.123456+00:00 myhost myapp[123]: NEXT PAGE message
    #    2025-03-10T11:49:44.838785+00:00 myhost myapp[123]: NEXT PAGE message
    #    2025-03-10T11:49:44.838785+00:00 myhost myapp[123]: LOADED message
    #    2025-03-10T11:49:44.838785+00:00 myhost myapp[123]: LOADED message
    #    2025-03-10T11:49:44.988548+00:00 myhost myapp[123]: LOADED message
    #    2025-03-10T11:49:44.988548+00:00 myhost myapp[123]: LOADED message
    #    2025-03-10T11:49:44.999000+00:00 myhost myapp[123]: LOADED message
    #    2025-03-10T11:49:44.999000+00:00 myhost myapp[123]: LOADED message
    #    2025-03-10T11:49:45.002143+00:00 myhost myapp[123]: LOADED message
    #
    # So we already have two messages at the "2025-03-10T11:49:44.838785"
    # timestamp, and the next page should start from the remaining one message
    # on the same timestamp.
    #
    # So first, even though we technically can pass the --until '2025-03-10 11:49:44.838785
    # argument to journalctl, which takes it without errors, it doesn't work
    # reliably: apparently the time indexing journalctl is doing does not have
    # microsecond precision, and it will actually stop EARLIER than the given
    # timestamp, missing arbitrary number of messages.
    #
    # To make sure that we do get all the messages we need, we have to request
    # a bit more, and round the --until timestamp to the next whole second:
    # '2025-03-10 11:49:45'. This is precisely what needs to be passed as the
    # --timestamp-until-seconds flag.
    #
    # And having that, we also need to know how many latest messages to filter
    # out, because we already have them. There are a few ways of doing it, but
    # currently implemented as follows:
    #
    # 1) --timestamp-until-precise is the exact timestamp of the very latest
    #    message we have, formatted the way journalctl formats it, i.e.
    #    '2025-03-10T11:49:44.838785'
    # 2) --skip-n-latest is how many messages we already have on this timestamp,
    #    i.e. '2' in this case.
    #
    # Having that, the agent script knows everything it needs to know, and the
    # logic is as follows (btw don't forget that we call journalctl with the
    # --reverse, so we first get the latest messages, which we need to skip):
    #
    # - Check if the current timestamp from journalctl string is
    #   lexicographically larger than the given --timestamp-until-precise. If
    #   so, just skip it: we're only receiving this line because our
    #   --timestamp-until-seconds was rounded up to the whole second
    # - Check if the current timestamp from journalctl string is exactly the
    #   same as the given --timestamp-until-precise. If so, skip up to the
    #   --skip-n-latest of such messages.
    # - Otherwise, we're good to include this message in the output.
    #
    # Now, why the journalctl built-in pagination mechanism (the --cursor and
    # related flags) doesn't work. Two primary reasons:
    #
    # - Journalctl only allows us to see the cursor of the *latest* message in
    #   the output;
    # - We apply our filters, and limit number of lines, *after* journalctl,
    #   using the awk script.
    #
    # So, there's no reliable way to say "print the latest N messages maching
    # this awk pattern, and show me the cursor of the first one, so that I can
    # later get next page".
    #
    # If there was a way to show the cursor for every single line that
    # journalctl outputs, then it might be possible, but then it would likely
    # make things even slower.
    #
    # So for now, we just have to hack around with the timestamps. Ugly, but
    # works, and covered with tests.

# Log file has 21789347 lines:
#
#ubuntu@dummy-node-01:~$ time cat /var/log/syslog.1 | tail -n +16789340 > /dev/null

#real    0m4.523s
#user    0m0.869s
#sys     0m6.915s
#ubuntu@dummy-node-01:~$ time tail -n +16789340 /var/log/syslog.1 > /dev/null

#real    0m2.184s
#user    0m0.660s
#sys     0m1.524s
#ubuntu@dummy-node-01:~$ time tail -n 5000000 /var/log/syslog.1 > /dev/null

#real    0m1.260s
#user    0m0.412s
#sys     0m0.848s

# do the "-n N", not "-n +N" (but for the latest logfile, which is constantly
# appended to, we have to use the "-n +N")
